# CSC 231: Fall 2024 - Project 4: LR(0) Parser

## Context
This graded project activity will have you demonstrate your ability to:

- Part 1: Implement components of an LR(0) parser,
- Part 2: Encode a grammar so that it can be used with the LR(0) parser you helped implement in Part 1 to check whether a set of words can be generated from the grammar.
- Part 3: Develop new tests to help determine the correctness of your work.
