# CSC 231: Fall 2024 - Project 2: FSM Design and Implementation

## Context
- Design a finite state machine that recognizes the exact set of words in that language.
- Implement in Java in a tabular from your designed finite state machine.

## Work
The alphabet for the machine is the four symbol set {A, C, G, T} (the DNA alphabet). The language your finite state machine should recognize is described as words that have the following structure:
